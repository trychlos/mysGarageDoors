 Description
 ===========

 Manage the two garage doors.

 The used mechanism (Sommer Duo) let us

  - simulate a push button to open/close the door
  - know if the door is opening or closing by monitoring the motor.

 Note that the push button in this mechanism only changes the move:
 - if the door was in move, the door is stopped;
 - if the door was not in move, then start the door the opposite direction
   the door was before it last stopped.

 We have to add a dry contact to know if the door is fully closed.

 During the move, we evaluate the position by comparing the duration of
 the move with the average delay.

 Note also that the energy is very briefly stopped at end of move. As a
 consequence, the Arduino processor is reset. As another consequence, the
 learning program has to save its state in EEPROM, in order to be able to
 continue after a reset.
 This energy cut is ( tried to be) handled via a 1000ÂµF capacity.

 Interactions
 ============

 The MySensors node present one main ID to the controller, to manage global
 actions and request or set global parameters.

 Each door present five IDs to the controller:
 - the first let us request or set parameters of the door management,
 - the four others are target of up, down and position messages (resp.).
